# Boden Around View Monitor Dataset

## Introduction

Boden Around View Monitor Dataset is a newly large-scale dataset for study and application purpose. It contains 20k images with mannully labeled annotations. The images in this dataset were Arround-view images synthesized from four low-cost fisheye cameras. Various parking-slot types were considered, including the vertical ones, the parallel ones, and the slant ones. The dataset was recorded in various indoor and outdoor parking sites. When collecting outdoor data, different illumination conditions and weather conditions were considered. 

Our sensor setup and fully equipped vehicle are illustrated in the following figure:
